  <p> 
  This package provides four different methods of annotating missing
  frames: 
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li> A big red <b>X</b> is drawn across the frame along with
  an error message.</li>
  <li> Text indcating the missing frame number</li>
  <li> Do nothing -- which essentially holds a previous good frame</li>
  <li> Clear to black </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  A sub-menu called "Missing Frames" is added to the View menu. This menu
  lets you choose which method to use for rendering the missing frames. The
  choice is stored in the application preferences -- so its remembered when
  you exit RV.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
  The "missing-frame" event is bound to a method in the mode. When RV
  detects a missing frame this event is sent. RV's default behavior is to
  render an earlier valid frame in place of the missing frame so the
  initial contents of the view is that frame.</p>

  <p>The mode has four methods: renderX, renderNothing, renderShow, and
  renderBlack which implement the different styles. When the event is
  received, one of the render functions is chosen from a list of
  name/function pairs. The name is stored in the settings automatically by
  the mode.</p>

  <p>You can control the display of the missing frame feedback option, by
  enabling or disabling "Display Feedback Message" appropriately.</p>
