ADDING AN IMAGE FILE FORMAT
---------------------------

RV's built-in JPEG reader/writer is provided as source code in the
src/io_jpeg_sample directory. 
You should be able to recompile the plugin yourself.

Use it as a template for your own image formats.


ADDING A MOVIE FILE FORMAT
--------------------------

Because movie file I/O tends to be more complex than image file I/O
we provide a very simple contrived example in src/mio_moovee_sample.


CUSTOMIZING RV'S USER INTERFACE SYSTEM WIDE
-------------------------------------------

Most of RV's user interface is implemented in the file 
plugins/Mu/rvui.mu. You can hack this file to change the behavior
and/or look of RV.


PERSONAL CUSTOMIZATION OF RV'S UI
---------------------------------

Copy scripts/rv/rvrc.mu to ~/.rvrc.mu and hack away.
