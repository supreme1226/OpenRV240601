    <h2>Channel Selection</h2>
    <p>
    This package adds a "user-defined" ColorChannel node to the View pipeline.
    You can find the node definition in Nodes/ColorSelect.gto, and the GLSL
    source code in Nodes/ColorSelect.glsl.  It's intended as a simple example
    of how a new node type can be incorporated into standard workflows without
    making the node visible to the user (by using the PipelineGroups).  From
    the user's point of view, they have new functionality, but no new "objects"
    in the session that they need to keep track of.
    <p>
    The ChannelSelect node is handy when the built-in channel selection on the
    View menu has been broken by replacing the DisplayColor node with an OCIO
    node, or when using in conjunction with the anaglyph stereo display mode.
    <p>
    By, default, the channel selection happens in the ViewPipeline, that is
    <b>before</b> the per-display device conditioning.  If for any reason you
    want to to happen _after_ conditioning for display, check the "Post-Display
    Channel Selection" item in the View menu.  This setting will be remembered
    as a preference.
    <p>
    Note that this package does not affect the "Channel Display" items on the View menu, just the hotkeys (r, g, b, a, c, l).
