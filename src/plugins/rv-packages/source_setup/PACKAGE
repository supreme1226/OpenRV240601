  <p>This package implements RV's default color and image geometry
  management. See also: 
  <a href="https://www.shotgridsoftware.com/rv">Color Management in RV Reference Manual</a> for more complete information.</p>

  <h4>The default new-source behavior</h4>

  <p>By default RV binds its own color management function located in the
  source_setup.mu file called sourceSetup(). This is part of the
  source_setup system package introduced in version 3.10.</p>

  <p>Its a good idea to override or augment this package for use in
  production environments. For example, you may want to have certain
  default color behavior for technical directors using movie files which
  differs from how a coordinator might view them (the coordinator may be
  looking at movies in sRGB space instead of with a film simulation for
  example).</p>

  <p>RV's default color management package tries to use good defaults for incoming file formats. Hereâ€™s
  the complete behavior shown as a set of heuristics applied in order:
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li>If the incoming image is a TIFF file and it has no color space attribute assume its linear</li>
  <li>If the image is JPEG or a quicktime movie file (.mov) and there is no color space attribute assume its in sRGB space</li>
  <li>If there is an embedded ICC profile and that profile is for sRGB space use RV's internal sRGB space transform instead (because RV does not yet handle embedded ICC profiles)</li>
  <li>If the image is TIFF and it was created by ifftoany, assume the pixel aspect ratio is incorrect and fix it</li>
  <li>If the image is JPEG, has no pixel aspect ratio attribute and no densisty attribute and looks like it comes from Maya, fix the pixel aspect ratio</li>

  <li>Use the proper built-in conversion for the color space indicated in the color space attribute of the image</li>
  <li>Use the sRGB display transform if any color space was successfully determined for the input image(s)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>From the user's point of view, the following situations will occur:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A DPX or Cineon is loaded which is determined to be in Log space -- turn on the built in log to linear converter</li>
  <li>A JPEG or Quicktime movie file is determined to be in sRGB space or if no space is specified assumed to be in sRGB space -- apply the built-in sRGB to linear converter</li>
  <li>An EXR is loaded -- assume its linear</li>
  <li>A TIFF file with no color space indication is assumed to be linear, if it does have a color space use that.</li>
  <li>A PNG file with no color space is assumed linear, otherwise use the color space attribute in the file</li>
  <li>Any file with a pixel aspect ratio attribute will be assumed to be correct (unless its determined to have come from Maya)<\li>
  <li>The monitor's gamma will be accounted for automatically (because RV assumes the monitor is an sRGB device)</li>
  </ul>
