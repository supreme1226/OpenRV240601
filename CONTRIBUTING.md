## Project Roles and Responsibilities

Please read this document to learn how to contribute to Open RV.

Start by getting familiar with the [GOVERNANCE](GOVERNANCE.md) document. It details the rules and responsibilities for Contributors, Committers, and Technical Steering Committee members.

## Committers

The RV Open Source Project Committers are listed in alphabetical order, by first name, in [COMMITERS](COMMITERS.md)

## Contributor License Agreement

Before contributing code to Open RV source code, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

You will get the opportunity to sign the CLA when you create your first pull request: the Linux Foundation's EasyCLA system will guide you through the process of signing the CLA.

If you can't to use the EasyCLA system, you can always send a signed CLA to `ori-tsc@aswf.io` (making sure to include your *github username*), and wait for confirmation that we've received it.

Here are the two possible CLAs:

There are two contribution agreement types, one for individuals contributing independently, and one for corporations who want to manage a list of contributors for their organization. Please review the documents in the EasyCLA portal to determine which is the right one for you.

## Coding Conventions

Please follow the coding conventions and style in each file and in each library when adding new files.

## Git Workflow

Follow instructions from the [README](README.md).
