  <p> 
  Export a movie/audio clip/file sequence for each region surrounded by
  marks on the timeline.
  </p>

  <p>
  To cut a single movie into lots of pieces: load it into RV, mark the
  timeline at each cut, and then File->Export->Marked Regions as ...
  </p> 

  <ul>
  <li> For movies: navigate to export dir and put something like export.mov
  <li> For audio: same idea but use export.aiff or export.wav
  <li> For image sequences: same thing but use e.g. export.#.jpg 
  </ul>

  <p>
  There's no way to stop it other than quit RV currently.
