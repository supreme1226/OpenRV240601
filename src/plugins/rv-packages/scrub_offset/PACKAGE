  <h2>Scrub Range Offset in Layout or Stack</h2>
  <p>
  For media with frame numbers (timecode or frame numbers in the filename of
  images in a sequence), those frame numbers determine the media's initial
  "local to global" frame number mapping.  The "range offset" property of a
  source can be used to adjust this mapping.
  <p>
  Suppose you want to compare two movies of two takes of the same shot in a
  tiled Layout, but the movies are renders of different frame ranges.  If the
  movies contain timecode, RV will line them up for you automatically, but if
  not, you can adjust the range offset to line them up.
  
  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>
  In the above example, suppose you know that both movies contain frame 38
  Scrub the timeline frame so that you can see frame 38 in movie.  Then select
  the menu item "Edit/ScrubRangeOffset", or hit "Shift-O", then mouse-down on
  the movie that is not showing frame 38 and scrub until it does.
  <p>
  You can use this in a Layout or a Stack (where you have used Wipes to expost
  some of the "lower" Sources), and in both cases on any number of Sources.
