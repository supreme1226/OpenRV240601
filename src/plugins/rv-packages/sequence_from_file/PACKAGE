  <p>
  Emulates programs which allow the user to specify a single image to infer
  an image sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
  Changes RV so that selecting a single file of a sequence in a file dialog
  or dropping a single file of a sequence onto the view will cause RV to
  load the entire sequence (assuming it can infer the correct files). 
  </p>

  <p>
  This mode can be toggled on/off via the menu item File/Options/One File → Sequence
  </p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>

  <p>
  The mode binds a method (fixpath) to the "incoming-source-path"
  event. This event is sent any time new media is being added to a
  session. The function which binds to it can replace the incoming path
  with a new path by setting the return value of the event to the new
  path. 
  </p>

  <p> The event contents has both a path and a "tag" which indicates where
  its being generated from. The tag currently has one of three values: ""
  (nothing), "explicit", or "session". "explicit" indicates that the user
  intended the file name to remain unchanged. In the case the mode does
  nothing. "session" indicates that the name is coming from an RV session
  file so the mode does nothing in that case as well.
